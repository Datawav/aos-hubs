# Exit Criteria for Foundry Projects

“Exit” doesn’t mean “you’re out.” It just means the project is in a different season.

## Graduation

A project is considered to have “graduated” from the Foundry when:

- It has a stable steward or team.
- It has a clear direction and a functioning roadmap.
- It no longer needs regular, structured support from AOS.

We may still:

- Stay in relationship as peers and collaborators.
- Feature the project in Lab convenings.
- Refer people to the project through Studio connections.

## Pause

Sometimes projects need to pause:

- People’s lives change.
- Contexts shift.
- Priorities move.

We mark a project as “paused” when:

- There has been no meaningful activity for a while.
- The founder or steward tells us they need to step back.
- Continuing to push would create more pressure than progress.

A pause is not a failure. It’s an honest reflection of reality.

## Transformation

Some projects evolve:

- The original idea morphs into something adjacent.
- Two projects decide to merge.
- A piece of a project spins out into its own tool or library.

When that happens, we talk with the founder(s) and decide whether:

- The new shape is a continuation of the existing Foundry relationship, or
- It makes more sense to treat it as a new project with a fresh orientation phase.

In all cases, we try to document the story in a way that respects people’s time, safety, and contributions.
