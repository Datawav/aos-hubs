# How Projects Join the Foundry

The Foundry is for projects that are ready to move from idea into focused, intentional building.

## What We Look For

We look less at pitch decks and more at:

- **Alignment** – Does the project support freedom, agency, and permissionless collaboration?
- **Stewardship** – Is there at least one person or a small group willing to steward the work?
- **Clarity of intent** – Is there a meaningful goal, even if the exact implementation is still evolving?
- **Openness** – Is the project open to learning in public, iterating, and engaging with a wider ecosystem?
- **Safety awareness** – Does the project take the safety of users, contributors, and communities seriously?

We do **not** require:

- A formal entity
- A fundraising plan
- A specific tech stack

## How Projects Enter

Most Foundry projects follow this path:

1. **Intake** – A founder or team reaches out via our website.
2. **Triage** – We apply the triage framework in [`../onboarding/02-triage-framework.md`](../onboarding/02-triage-framework.md).
3. **Discovery session** – We run a discovery call using the guide in [`../onboarding/03-discovery-session-guide.md`](../onboarding/03-discovery-session-guide.md).
4. **Proposal** – We co-create a lightweight understanding of what Foundry support might look like.
5. **Mutual “yes”** – Both the project and AOS agree to walk together for at least a season.

If at any point we realize Foundry isn’t the right context, we may instead suggest Lab convenings or Studio matchmaking.

## What We Ask of Founders

We ask Foundry projects to:

- Show up with honesty about constraints, risks, and capacity.
- Commit to some rhythm of communication with us (even if it’s very lightweight).
- Be open to input from the broader AOS ecosystem.
- Respect the time and safety of contributors and collaborators.

There is no equity, no ownership transfer, and no hidden agenda. If that ever changes for a specific project, we’ll document it clearly.
