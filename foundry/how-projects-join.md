# How Projects Join the Foundry

The Foundry is for projects ready to move from idea into focused, intentional building.

## What We Look For

We look less at pitch decks and more at:

- **Alignment** - Does the project support freedom, agency, and permissionless collaboration?
- **Stewardship** - Is there at least one person willing to steward the work?
- **Clarity of intent** - Is there a meaningful goal, even if implementation is still evolving?
- **Openness** - Is the project open to learning in public and engaging with the ecosystem?
- **Safety awareness** - Does the project take the safety of users, contributors, and communities seriously?

We do **not** require a formal entity, a fundraising plan, or a specific tech stack.

## How Projects Enter

1. **Intake** - A founder or team reaches out via [our website](https://andotherstuff.org/express-interest.html)
2. **Triage** - We apply the [triage framework](../onboarding/02-triage-framework.md)
3. **Discovery session** - We run a [discovery call](../onboarding/03-discovery-session-guide.md)
4. **Proposal** - We co-create a lightweight understanding of what Foundry support looks like
5. **Mutual "yes"** - Both sides agree to walk together for at least a season (minimum 3 months, though duration varies by project)

If Foundry isn't the right context, we may suggest Lab explorations or Studio matchmaking instead.

## Agreements

Most Foundry relationships are informal, but we do establish clear agreements - especially when funding is involved. There is no equity, no ownership transfer, and no hidden agenda. If terms exist for a specific project, they're documented explicitly.

## What We Ask of Founders

- Show up honestly about constraints, risks, and capacity
- Commit to regular communication with us (at least monthly, more if needed)
- Be open to input from the broader AOS ecosystem
- Respect the time and safety of contributors and collaborators
