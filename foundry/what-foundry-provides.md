# What the Foundry Provides

The Foundry is not a promise of unlimited resources. It's a commitment to walk alongside a project in a focused way.

Depending on capacity and fit, we may provide:

- **Clarity and framing** - Help refining goals, scope, and success criteria
- **Discovery and design support** - Light research, UX input, and product framing
- **Technical thought partnership** - Architecture conversations, Nostr/Cashu/Bitcoin integration thinking, and patterns for safe-by-design systems
- **Ecosystem context** - Understanding who else is working in related spaces and how to align rather than duplicate
- **Connections** - Introductions to people and services in our [Studio](../studio/) Rolodex
- **Convening** - Bringing a small group together around questions the project is wrestling with
- **Funding** - When appropriate and with clear agreements, direct financial support for development

We don't promise unlimited funding, full-time dev teams, or endless operations support. When we direct resources to a project, we agree together on scope, expectations, and boundaries.
