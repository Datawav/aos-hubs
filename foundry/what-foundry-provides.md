# What the Foundry Provides

The Foundry is not a promise of unlimited resources. It’s a commitment to **walk alongside** a project in a focused way.

Depending on capacity and fit, we may provide:

- **Clarity and framing** – Help refining goals, scope, and success criteria.
- **Discovery and design support** – Light research, UX input, and product framing.
- **Technical thought partnership** – Architecture conversations, Nostr/Cashu/Bitcoin integration thinking, and patterns for safe-by-design systems.
- **Ecosystem context** – Understanding who else is working in related spaces and how to align rather than duplicate.
- **Connections** – Introductions to people and services in our Studio Rolodex.
- **Convening** – Bringing a small group together around specific questions the project is wrestling with.

We don’t promise:

- Funding
- Full-time dev teams
- Endless operations support

When we do access or direct resources, we’ll agree together on the scope, expectations, and boundaries.
