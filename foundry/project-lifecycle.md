# Project Lifecycle in the Foundry

We think in terms of seasons and cycles rather than rigid phases. Still, it’s helpful to describe the typical lifecycle of a Foundry project.

## 1. Orientation

- We get to know the founder(s) and the project.
- We confirm alignment and safety considerations.
- We agree on a short-term focus (e.g., “validate the core user need,” “ship a v0.1 MVP,” “test a coordination pattern”).

## 2. Exploration and Framing

- We refine the problem statement and goals.
- We identify core users or communities.
- We consider risks and unintended consequences.
- We map dependencies on protocols, infrastructure, and other actors.

## 3. Building and Iterating

- The project builds, with support from AOS and Studio contributors as appropriate.
- We use small experiments and tight feedback loops.
- We treat code, docs, and process as co-evolving.

## 4. Reflection and Adjustment

- We pause periodically to ask: what’s working, what’s not, what has changed?
- We adjust scope or direction based on what we’re learning.
- We revisit safety and governance questions as needed.

## 5. Graduation, Pause, or Transformation

Eventually, a Foundry project will either:

- **Graduate** – It has its own momentum, team, and structures, and no longer needs regular Foundry support.
- **Pause** – The project goes dormant due to capacity, context, or strategy.
- **Transform** – The project evolves into something new, possibly re-entering as a new Foundry project.

See [`exit-criteria.md`](./exit-criteria.md) for how we recognize and handle these transitions.
