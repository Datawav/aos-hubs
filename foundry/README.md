# Foundry

The Foundry is where we walk alongside projects and founders as they design, build, and ship tools in the permissionless tech ecosystem.

We don’t act like a VC, an incubator, or a boss. We act as collaborators, fellow builders, and stewards of shared infrastructure and shared values.

This directory explains how projects join the Foundry, what we offer, how the project lifecycle works, and what “graduation” or exit looks like.
