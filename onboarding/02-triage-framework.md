# Triage Framework

Once an intake form comes in, we make an initial decision about where it best fits in the AOS ecosystem. This helps us direct our limited attention where it can be most helpful.

We use three primary buckets:

- **Foundry** – project-focused partnership and building
- **Lab** – exploration, convening, and collective learning
- **Studio** – people, services, and expertise

## Step 1: Is This Primarily a Person or a Project?

We start by asking:

> Is this person primarily offering *skills and services*, or asking for *help with a project or idea*?

- If they’re offering skills → likely **Studio**.
- If they’re asking for help with a project/idea → likely **Foundry** or **Lab**.

Sometimes it's both. That’s fine. We tag all relevant dimensions.

## Step 2: Foundry vs Lab for Projects

If it's a project or idea, we ask:

1. **Is there a founder or core steward who feels accountable for it?**
2. **Is there a reasonably clear goal, even if the path is fuzzy?**
3. **Is there some sense of who the project is for?** (users, communities, movements)

If the answer to most of these is **yes**, we lean toward **Foundry** and propose a discovery session.

If the project is more like a **question, exploration, or early concept** without a clear steward or path, we lean toward **Lab** and consider whether it could become a topic for a working group, hackathon, or ideation popup.

## Step 3: Studio Fit for Contributors

If someone is offering skills or services, we ask:

1. What domains do they work in? (product, research, design, development, infra, operations, etc.)
2. Do they have constraints around visibility, safety, or time?
3. Do they want to be directly matched to projects, or just be on the radar?

If there’s a good values and safety fit, we create or update a contributor entry in the Studio Rolodex (see [`../studio/`](../studio/)).

## Step 4: Edge Cases

- **Too early / too vague** – We may invite the person into a Lab convening first.
- **Out of scope** – We may point them to other communities or resources better suited to their needs.
- **High-risk contexts** – We may limit what we document and how we connect them, to avoid exposing them to additional risk.

The goal of triage is not to judge worthiness. It’s to be honest about where we can actually help.
