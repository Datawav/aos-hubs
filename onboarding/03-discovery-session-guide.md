# Discovery Session Guide

For many projects and ideas, we schedule a short discovery session with the founder or core team. This helps us understand what they’re trying to do and how we might support them.

## Purpose

We run discovery sessions to:

- Hear the founder’s story in their own words
- Clarify goals and definitions of success
- Understand constraints, risks, and blockers
- Decide whether the best fit is Foundry, Lab, Studio, or some combination

It’s a conversation, not an interview.

## Format

- **Duration:** 30–45 minutes
- **Participants:** 1–2 people from AOS and the founder(s)
- **Mode:** Usually video or audio call; text-only if safer or preferred

## Core Questions

We anchor the session around three core questions:

1. **What is your goal with this project or idea?**  
   We listen for both the concrete goal (e.g., “ship an MVP”) and the deeper intention (e.g., “help people coordinate during internet shutdowns”).

2. **What does success look like for you?**  
   This includes both project outcomes (impact, users, deployments) and personal outcomes (learning, sustainability, reputation, safety).

3. **What encouragement, help, and support do you need to overcome what’s in the way?**  
   We ask about barriers: technical, emotional, political, logistical, safety-related, or resource-related.

We may also ask:

- Who is this for?
- What have you already tried?
- How do you like to collaborate (async/sync, tools, pace)?
- Are there specific risks we should be aware of?

## What We Capture

Internally, we document:

- A short summary
- The founder’s stated goals and success criteria
- The main obstacles they named
- Our initial thoughts on whether Foundry, Lab, or Studio is the best fit

We do **not** publish these notes publicly. The public docs you see here describe *how* we run the process, not what any individual shared with us.

## What Happens Next

After the call, we:

1. Reflect as an AOS team on where we can genuinely add value.
2. Propose a path: Foundry, Lab, Studio, or a mix.
3. Share that back with the founder along with next steps.
4. Stay honest if we aren’t the right fit, and try to point to other resources when we can.
