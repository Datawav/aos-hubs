# Routing Guide: Foundry, Lab, and Studio

After triage and (if needed) a discovery session, we decide where to route a project, idea, or contributor within the AOS hubs.

We’re not trying to “score” or “rank” people. We’re trying to place them in a context where they can actually move forward.

## When We Route to Foundry

We tend to route projects into the **Foundry** when:

- There is a clear or emerging founder or steward.
- There’s some traction, validation, or strong conviction.
- The project fits our focus on permissionless tech, open protocols, and freedom-supporting tools.
- We believe we can walk alongside the team in a meaningful way.

Foundry is where we invest more ongoing attention into a project. See [`../foundry/how-projects-join.md`](../foundry/how-projects-join.md) for details.

## When We Route to Lab

We route topics or ideas into the **Lab** when:

- The core need is exploration, not execution.
- The idea is still forming and would benefit from more perspectives.
- The question is bigger than one project (e.g., “How do we design safer coordination tools for activists?”).

Lab is where we convene working groups, hackathons, special interest groups, ideation popups, and curated conversations. See [`../lab/`](../lab/) for how that works.

## When We Route to Studio

We route people into the **Studio** when:

- They’re offering skills, services, or deep expertise.
- They want to support projects in product, research, design, management, or technical domains.
- They want to be connected to aligned projects without necessarily joining a single team.

Studio is our ecosystem Rolodex and service directory. See [`../studio/`](../studio/) for more.

## Mixed Routing

Sometimes the answer is “all of the above”:

- A founder might bring a project that belongs in the Foundry **and** want to join Lab conversations on related topics.
- A contributor might join the Studio Rolodex **and** propose a Lab working group.

We encourage these overlaps. Our routing is flexible by design.

## Saying “Not Now” or “Not Here”

There are times when we decide we’re **not** the right place, at least for now. When that happens, we try to:

- Be honest and kind about why.
- Respect confidentiality and safety.
- Point to adjacent communities or resources when we know them.

Our capacity is finite. Our commitment to treating people with respect is not.
