# Studio Directory Structure

We maintain a partially public structure so people can understand what kinds of expertise exist in the ecosystem, without forcing every contributor to expose their identity.

## Public vs Private

- **Public:** directory structure, role types, contributor profile template, and any contributor who chooses a public-facing profile.
- **Private:** sensitive contact details, legal names (if different from public handles), and any information that could increase risk for someone doing sensitive work.

## Layout

In this repository, public information lives here:

- `studio/service-types.md` – overview of service categories.
- `studio/contributor-profile-template.md` – how we structure contributor info.
- `studio/public-profiles/` – optional public profiles for contributors who choose visibility.

Internally, we may maintain a separate, non-public store for:

- private contact details
- redacted notes about availability
- references or past collaboration context

## Pseudonyms and Partial Profiles

We welcome:

- pseudonymous contributors
- role-only listings (e.g., “senior cryptography reviewer in EU timezone”)
- profiles that list a Nostr or GitHub handle but no legal name

Our goal is to make collaboration easier **without** increasing anyone’s exposure to risk.
