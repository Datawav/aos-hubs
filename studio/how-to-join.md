# How to Join the Studio

The Studio is for people who want to contribute skills to freedom tech projects without necessarily joining a single team full-time.

## Who We're Looking For

Contributors who can help with:

- Product strategy, UX, and research
- Design, branding, and storytelling
- Management, operations, and back office
- Software development and infrastructure

See [service-types.md](./service-types.md) for more detail.

## How to Join

Submit through the [intake form](https://andotherstuff.org/express-interest.html), indicating you want to contribute as a collaborator or service provider.

We'll follow up to understand your skills, availability, and how you'd like to work. Initial onboarding into the Rolodex typically takes a week or two.

Being in the Rolodex doesn't mean immediate work - it means you're available when a matching opportunity comes up.

## What We Expect

**Availability:** Be clear about your capacity (hours per month, between projects, etc.) and keep it updated.

**Responsiveness:** When we reach out about a potential match, respond within a reasonable timeframe - even if just to say you're not available.

**Honesty:** If something isn't working, say so early.

## Privacy and Safety

You can be pseudonymous. You can limit what's public. We won't share sensitive details without consent. See [directory-structure.md](./directory-structure.md) for how we handle public vs private information.
