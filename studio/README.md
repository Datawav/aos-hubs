# Studio

The Studio is our ecosystem Rolodex and services hub.

It’s where we keep track of people and groups who can help projects with:

- product strategy, UX, and research
- design, branding, and storytelling
- management, operations, and back office
- software development and infrastructure

Some of these people are part of AOS. Many are not. What they share is a commitment to open, permissionless ecosystems and to the communities those systems are meant to serve.

We design the Studio to respect privacy and safety. Not everyone wants or can afford to be fully visible, especially in high-risk contexts. This directory explains how we structure the Rolodex, how contributors can be listed, and how projects can request support.
