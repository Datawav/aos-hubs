# Public Profiles

This directory is for contributors who choose to have a public-facing profile in the Studio.

Each profile should:

- follow the structure in [`../contributor-profile-template.md`](../contributor-profile-template.md)
- respect the contributor’s own safety and privacy boundaries
- avoid doxxing or revealing sensitive affiliations without consent

If you are a contributor and would like your profile added, updated, or removed, please open an issue or contact an AOS steward through the channels described on our website.
