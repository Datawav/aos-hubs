# Service Types in the Studio

The Studio helps connect projects with people who can support them in three broad categories.

## 1. Product and Experience

Examples:

- product strategy and roadmapping
- UX research and participatory design
- interaction and interface design
- content strategy and information architecture
- accessibility and inclusive design reviews

## 2. Management and Back Office

Examples:

- project and program management
- governance and facilitation
- financial operations and basic accounting
- legal research and policy navigation (not legal advice)
- documentation and knowledge management

## 3. Technical and Infrastructure

Examples:

- software architecture and development
- protocol integration (e.g., Nostr, Bitcoin, Cashu)
- infrastructure design and hosting strategies
- security reviews and threat modeling (at an appropriate scope)
- data engineering and analytics

These categories are not rigid. Many contributors cross boundaries. The purpose is to help projects navigate the ecosystem and understand what kind of support they might need.
