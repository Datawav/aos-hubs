# How Projects Request Support from the Studio

Foundry and Lab projects can request support from the Studio when they need specific skills or services.

## How to Ask

Typically, a project will share:

- a short description of the project
- what they are trying to achieve
- what kind of help they think they need
- any constraints (timeline, budget, safety, timezones)

This might come through:

- a short form
- a direct message to an AOS steward
- a follow-up from a Foundry or Lab session

## How We Match

When we receive a request, we:

1. Clarify the ask if needed.
2. Look at the Studio Rolodex (public and private).
3. Identify potential matches based on skills, values, safety, and availability.
4. Reach out to potential contributors to gauge interest.
5. Make introductions if there’s mutual interest.

We try hard not to waste contributors’ time or put pressure on anyone to say yes.

## Agreements and Compensation

We expect projects and contributors to:

- agree directly on scope, deliverables, and compensation (if any)
- be honest about capacity and timelines
- respect each other’s boundaries and safety

AOS may occasionally be a party to these agreements, but often we are just the connector.

## When We Say No or Not Yet

Sometimes we’re unable to find a good match or the timing doesn’t work. When that happens, we’ll say so rather than overpromising.

We would rather be clear about limits than overextend ourselves or our community.
