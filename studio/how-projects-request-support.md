# How Projects Request Support from the Studio

Foundry and Lab projects can request support from the Studio when they need specific skills or services.

## How to Ask

Share with an AOS steward:

- A short description of the project
- What you're trying to achieve
- What kind of help you need
- Any constraints (timeline, budget, safety, timezones)

This might come through a form, a direct message, or a follow-up from a Foundry or Lab session.

## How We Match

1. Clarify the ask if needed
2. Search the Rolodex (public and private) for potential fits
3. Reach out to potential contributors to gauge interest
4. Make introductions if there's mutual interest

We try not to waste contributors' time or pressure anyone to say yes.

## Timeline

Initial response is usually quick. Finding an actual match depends on what you need and who's available - sometimes days, sometimes weeks, sometimes we can't find anyone.

## Agreements and Compensation

Projects and contributors agree directly on scope, deliverables, and compensation (if any). Be honest about capacity and timelines. Respect each other's boundaries.

AOS may occasionally be party to these agreements, but often we're just the connector.

## When Matches Don't Work Out

Sometimes a match isn't the right fit - communication styles clash, capacity changes, or the work isn't what either side expected.

When that happens, either party can end the engagement. Let AOS know so we can help find a replacement if needed and learn from what didn't work.

## When We Say No

Sometimes we can't find a good match or the timing doesn't work. We'll say so rather than overpromise.
