# Types of Convenings

Lab activities take different forms. This isn't rigid - formats blend and evolve.

## Working Groups

**What:** Small group exploring a question over time
**Size:** 3-7 people | **Duration:** Weeks to months | **Format:** Async chat + periodic calls

Best for sustained attention and depth. Most Lab activity happens here. See [working-groups.md](./working-groups.md).

## Hackathons / Build Sprints

**What:** Focused building to prototype or ship something
**Size:** 5-20 people | **Duration:** Hours to days | **Format:** Intensive synchronous work

Best when the question is "can we build this?" and you need concentrated energy.

## Research Circles

**What:** Group investigation, gathering and synthesizing information
**Size:** 3-10 people | **Duration:** Weeks | **Format:** Distributed research + synthesis sessions

Best when the answer exists but is scattered.

## Design Sessions

**What:** Collaborative design on a specific problem
**Size:** 3-8 people | **Duration:** One or more sessions | **Format:** Synchronous with shared docs

Best for making design decisions together with immediate feedback.

## Discussion / Reading Groups

**What:** Structured conversation around ideas or papers
**Size:** 5-15 people | **Duration:** Single session or series | **Format:** Prepared material + facilitated discussion

Best for building shared understanding before tackling a problem.

## Ideation Sessions

**What:** Open-ended brainstorming
**Size:** 5-12 people | **Duration:** 1-3 hours | **Format:** Structured prompts

Best at the beginning when you're not sure what the question should be.

## Advisory Calls

**What:** Outside expertise on a specific question
**Size:** 2-5 people | **Duration:** 30-60 min | **Format:** Prepared questions + discussion

Best when you need expertise the group doesn't have.
