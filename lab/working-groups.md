# Working Groups

Working groups are how most Lab exploration happens. A small group with relevant expertise tackles a shared question.

## Principles

**Small by default.** As few people as possible while having necessary expertise. Three to seven is typical.

**Self-organizing.** Groups decide their own structure and cadence. AOS provides facilitation but doesn't dictate.

**Output-oriented.** Groups exist to produce something useful - even if that's "we learned this doesn't work."

**Time-bounded.** Most groups should have a natural end point. Ongoing is fine if the question is ongoing, but default to finishing.

## Formation

When a topic is accepted, AOS identifies seed participants through curated invites. Participants suggest others. Open calls happen if broader input is needed.

You don't need to have gone through AOS intake to join. If someone invites you and you're interested, you're welcome.

## Operations

**Communication:** Signal for async discussion and calls. Jitsi for longer video. GitHub for docs and code.

**Cadence:** No prescribed schedule. Groups meet when needed - multiple times per week during intense phases, monthly during low activity.

**Facilitation:** AOS can help with meeting facilitation, process design, conflict navigation, and connections. Available, not required.

**Documentation:** Groups decide what to document. Recording only happens if explicitly wanted. Default to privacy.

## Participation Modes

**Leading:** Driving agenda, coordinating, ensuring progress.
**Regular:** Attending most sessions, contributing actively.
**Sporadic:** Dropping in when relevant.
**Advisory:** Occasional input, available for questions.

All modes are valuable. Be clear about your capacity.

## Compensation

Most participation is interest-driven, but compensation is available when the work requires significant time, participants couldn't otherwise afford to contribute, or the output is critical.

## Safety and Ethics

Because Lab work often touches real-world risk:

- **Consent and privacy:** Be clear about what's shared with whom. Default to minimal disclosure.
- **Data handling:** If data is collected, decide upfront how it's stored and deleted.
- **Harm considerations:** Who could be affected if this work is misused?
- **At-risk participants:** Some may be pseudonymous or in sensitive contexts. Respect that.

When in doubt, slow down and widen the circle.

## When Groups Get Stuck

**No momentum:** Check if the question still matters. Reduce scope. Set a deadline.

**Disagreement:** Make it explicit. Consider multiple outputs. Escalate to AOS if needed.

**Scope creep:** Return to original framing. Spin off related questions. Declare what's out of scope.

**Wrong people:** Identify who's missing. Recruit or pause.

## Ending

Groups end when output is complete, the question is answered, energy dies, or the topic graduates to Foundry.

When ending: summarize learnings, decide where outputs live, thank participants, close or mark the Signal group dormant.
