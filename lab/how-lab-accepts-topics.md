# How the Lab Accepts Topics

The Lab is driven by real questions from real people, not by a central agenda.

## Who Can Propose a Topic?

Anyone in or adjacent to the AOS ecosystem can propose a Lab topic:

- founders
- contributors
- researchers
- organizers and activists
- infrastructure and protocol builders

## What Makes a Good Lab Topic?

We look for topics that:

- matter to people using or building permissionless tech
- require more than one perspective to understand
- have some potential to inform real tools, practices, or governance

Examples:

- “How do we design for activists in low-connectivity environments?”
- “What does accountable moderation look like on open protocols?”
- “How can we support youth safety without replicating surveillance capitalism?”

## What Happens After You Propose?

When you propose a topic, we:

1. Read and reflect on your proposal.
2. Consider who else might care about this.
3. Decide what kind of convening (if any) makes sense:
   - working group
   - SIG session
   - hackathon
   - ideation popup
   - curated conversations

We’ll share back whether and how we can support it. Sometimes the answer is “not yet,” and we try to be honest about why.
