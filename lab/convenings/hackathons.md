# Hackathons

Hackathons are time-boxed sprints where people come together to build, test, and explore.

## Purpose

We use hackathons when:

- We want to energize a community around a theme.
- We want to test feasibility or surface new ideas quickly.
- We want to create a playful space for experimentation.

## Structure

- **Duration:** usually 1–3 days, sometimes async over a week
- **Participation:** open call with some curation for safety and fit
- **Output:** demoable prototypes, experiments, or patterns

## How We Run Hackathons

We try to:

- Make themes concrete but broad (e.g., “safer coordination tools for protests”).
- Encourage cross-pollination between designers, developers, researchers, organizers, and others.
- Support teams with mentors or office hours from the Studio Rolodex.
- Center safety, consent, and respect for lived experience.

Not every hackathon output becomes a Foundry project. That’s okay. The exploration is valuable on its own.
