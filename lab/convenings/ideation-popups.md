# Ideation Popups

Ideation popups are short, one-off sessions where we invite a small group to think together about a specific idea, challenge, or opportunity.

## Purpose

We use ideation popups when:

- Something is emerging and we want quick, multi-perspective input.
- A founder or team wants to pressure-test a concept.
- We want to generate options before committing to a direction.

## Structure

- **Duration:** 60–90 minutes
- **Participants:** curated mix of people with relevant experience and lived context
- **Output:** notes, themes, and potential next steps

An ideation popup might lead to:

- a better-shaped Foundry proposal,
- a Lab working group,
- or simply a clearer “not this, not now” decision.
