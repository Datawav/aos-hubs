# Special Interest Groups (SIGs)

Special interest groups are recurring gatherings of people who care about a particular domain (e.g., youth safety, decentralized identity, low-resource environments).

## Purpose

SIGs are for:

- ongoing peer exchange
- sharing evolving practices and research
- building relationships across projects and geographies

## Structure

- **Membership:** open to anyone aligned with the values of the group
- **Cadence:** regular, but flexible (monthly, quarterly, etc.)
- **Format:** calls, async channels, or a mix

SIGs often surface questions or themes that later become working groups, hackathons, or Foundry projects.
