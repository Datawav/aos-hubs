# Curated Conversations

Curated conversations are 1:1 or small-group dialogues that we help set up and sometimes facilitate.

## Purpose

We curate conversations when:

- Two or more people are working on similar or complementary problems.
- There’s potential for mutual learning or collaboration.
- A founder would benefit from talking with someone who has walked a similar path.

## Structure

- **Format:** can be 1:1 or small group
- **Privacy:** often off-the-record to support candid sharing
- **Role of AOS:** we broker the connection and, when appropriate, stay involved to support follow-up

Curated conversations are one of the quiet ways we add value. We don’t need credit; we care that useful connections are made.
