# Working Groups

Working groups are small, focused circles that meet over time to explore a shared topic or challenge.

## Purpose

We use working groups when:

- A question is too big for one meeting.
- There’s enough interest to sustain ongoing conversation.
- We want to move toward concrete insights, patterns, or prototypes.

## Structure

- **Size:** typically 4–10 people
- **Duration:** a few sessions over weeks or months
- **Format:** regular calls or async collaboration, depending on participants
- **Output:** could be notes, patterns, prototypes, or recommendations

## Starting a Working Group

Anyone in the ecosystem can propose a working group topic by:

- describing the question or challenge,
- naming who they think should be in the conversation,
- sharing what “progress” would look like.

We use these proposals to decide which groups we can support with facilitation, documentation, or infrastructure.
