# Lab

The Lab is where we convene. It’s where we bring people together around shared questions, opportunities, and challenges in the permissionless tech ecosystem.

Instead of assuming one project has all the answers, we use the Lab to:

- explore ideas collectively
- compare patterns across contexts
- listen to the people most affected by the tools we build
- test things in low-stakes, exploratory ways

This directory documents the types of convenings we run and how topics move through the Lab.
