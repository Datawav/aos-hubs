# Lab

The Lab is where AOS convenes explorations around questions bigger than any single project. Unlike the Foundry (active projects) or Studio (contributors), the Lab is for open questions the ecosystem needs to figure out together.

## Current Explorations

- Nostr developer newsletter (coordination and content)
- Encrypted file storage on Blossom (technical design)

## How It Works

1. Someone proposes a topic through the [intake form](https://andotherstuff.org/express-interest.html) or from a Foundry project
2. AOS routes it to Lab if it's exploratory rather than execution-focused
3. A working group forms - small, self-organizing, with the right expertise
4. They explore, then outputs go somewhere useful - published, integrated, or archived

## Participation

Lab activities are invite-based but open to anyone with relevant interest. You don't need to have gone through AOS intake to join if someone invites you. Participation ranges from leading a group to dropping in occasionally. Compensation is available when needed.

Tools: Signal for communication, GitHub for collaboration, Jitsi for video. Remote-first.
