# How the Lab Works

The Lab takes questions and turns them into useful outputs.

## The Cycle

```
Propose → Route → Form Group → Explore → Output → Integrate/Archive
```

## 1. Proposal

Topics enter through two paths:

**External**: Someone submits through the [intake form](https://andotherstuff.org/express-interest.html). The intake team routes Lab-appropriate topics. See [proposing-a-topic.md](./proposing-a-topic.md).

**Internal**: A Foundry project hits a question bigger than their project. The lead proposes it to AOS, and we convene a Lab exploration.

## 2. Routing

The intake team decides Lab vs. Foundry vs. Studio. Key signals for Lab:

- Exploration, not execution
- Affects multiple projects or the whole ecosystem
- No clear owner yet
- Would benefit from diverse perspectives

See [../onboarding/04-routing-guide.md](../onboarding/04-routing-guide.md) for full criteria.

## 3. Working Group Formation

A small group self-organizes around the question. AOS identifies initial participants through curated invites, then participants recruit others as needed. See [working-groups.md](./working-groups.md).

## 4. Exploration

Format varies: research, design, building, discussion. AOS provides facilitation, connections, feedback, and funding when needed.

## 5. Output

Whatever the question requires: reports, specs, prototypes, or just shared understanding. Not everything produces a polished artifact.

## 6. Integration

Useful outputs get published, integrated into Foundry projects, or handed off as new projects. Failed explorations get documented as learning. See [graduation-and-handoff.md](./graduation-and-handoff.md).

## Decision-Making

**Who decides if a topic enters Lab?** The intake team.

**Who decides how a group operates?** The group itself, with AOS support.

**Who decides graduation to Foundry?** Lab lead proposes, AOS core decides.

**Who decides when it's done?** The group, with AOS sign-off.
