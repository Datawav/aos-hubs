# How the Lab Scopes Projects and Experiments

Sometimes Lab work leads directly into small experiments, prototypes, or pattern libraries.

## From Question to Experiment

When a topic seems ripe for experimentation, we help the group:

- sharpen the question,
- identify a small, testable slice,
- decide what “learning” would look like,
- and design an experiment that is respectful, ethical, and safe.

## Output Types

Lab work might produce:

- design prompts and patterns
- research summaries or annotated bibliographies
- prototype interfaces or interaction flows
- contributions to existing open-source tools
- ideas ready to enter the Foundry as a project

We care that the output can travel: other people should be able to pick it up and use it.

## Safety and Ethics

Because we often work near real-world risk, we pay attention to:

- consent and privacy
- how data is handled (if any is collected)
- who could be harmed if our work is misused

When in doubt, we slow down and widen the circle of people weighing in.
