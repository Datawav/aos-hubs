# Proposing a Topic to the Lab

Have a question the ecosystem needs to figure out? Here's how to bring it to the Lab.

## What Makes a Good Lab Topic

Lab topics are **questions**, not projects.

| Project (Foundry) | Question (Lab) |
|-------------------|----------------|
| "I'm building X" | "How should X work?" |
| Has a founder/owner | Needs collective exploration |
| Ready to execute | Needs research/design first |

Good Lab topics affect multiple projects, don't have obvious answers, and would benefit from diverse perspectives.

**Current examples:**
- How do we coordinate a Nostr developer newsletter?
- What would encrypted file storage on Blossom look like?

## How to Propose

**Option 1: Intake form.** Submit through [andotherstuff.org/express-interest.html](https://andotherstuff.org/express-interest.html). Describe the question, why it matters, who else might care, and what you hope to learn.

**Option 2: From a Foundry project.** If you're already working with AOS and hit a question bigger than your project, raise it with your AOS contact. We'll evaluate whether to spin off a Lab exploration.

## What Happens Next

1. **Acknowledgment** within 1 week
2. **Triage** by intake team (1-2 weeks)
3. **Discovery call** if promising
4. **Routing decision**: Lab, Foundry, or something else

If accepted, we'll help form a working group and clarify what success looks like. If not, we'll explain why and point to other resources when we can.

## You Don't Need Permission

The Lab is for questions that benefit from AOS convening. But you can always explore questions on your own or in other communities. If you start something and later want AOS involvement, you can still propose it.
